## Nicola Stebbing, welcome to nicolastebbing.com!

Hallochen!

I was bored and this felt like a belated birthday present that may be more useful than a lamp. I'm also still convinced that I can fix your broken lamp.

There was supposed to be some sexy black and white photos here but apparently I'm incapable of loading film into a film camera.

I have the domain (nicolastebbing.com) for two years and can put it in your name properly at any point. Similarly the code for the website is on my GitHub account, so you can log in to mine and mess around or you can set up your own GitHub and I can transfer. You can also use the domain with any other ways that you may want to build a website, I just got it going with GitHub as it's free and I know how to do it.

Thought this would be useful for general messing around and getting your portfolio stuff out into the world at some point. I considered nicolastebbing.design, but Finlay rightfully pointed out that that would look a bit weird if you decided you weren't going to be doing much of the design stuff anymore. 

Hope it comes in useful at some point.

Lots of love,

Sam x
